## Review
In this project and this week, I struggled to keep up and decided to manage my time more wisely by catching myself up on the week I am in for the SQL Module, and to finish my Unit Assessment.
I have been having some health issues going on in the background, and in order to help regulate my stress, as well as to absorb the information I ambeing taught in the most effective manner, I have decided to use one of my "Challenge Passes" for this module. 
JSONs are not something I fully grasp and intend to review on my own time and do soon, but catching up on this assignment in time to be able to get a grade is not possible for me to accomplish.

Thank you for reading.
